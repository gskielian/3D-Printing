3DTin
=====

3DTin allows you to, for free, create a vast amount of 3D shapes and text from a warehouse of user-generated examples.

In order to export to .stl, you will first need to login (which requires email address), but the trade-off is that you will for example, be able to utilize automatic text-generation to make custom stamps/logos.
