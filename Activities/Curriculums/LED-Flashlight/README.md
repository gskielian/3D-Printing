LED Flashlight
==============


Something very good to know about metal is that it reacts with the oxygen in the air, and when it does it creates this annoying layer of "metal + oxygen" which doesn't conduct electricity!!!

There are ways to get around this -- the first is to use solder them together.

Our watch batteries will need good contacts with the batter holder pins, so we might want to simply solder wires directly onto it to ensure good contact (oxygen simply can't get between the two).

But watch batteries have a lot of polish as well, therefore we will need to take off that layer first using a special sand-paper used for steel:  Aluminum Oxide Sandpaper.


So the steps will be the following:

1. sand the batteries
2. solder the batteries to wires
3. connect the wires to a switch
4. solder the switch to an LED


This will result in creation of a remarkably compact, bright, and efficient LED battery light.b
